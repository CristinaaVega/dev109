        <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
        <p>
            I love gardening and animals in general. In my free time, I play golf, paint, hike, knit, bake, cook, and watch shows. 
            I am a content creator on social media and have built a large community with over **1 million followers**. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            I am currently in the process of switching my major from **Software Development to Business**. After two years of college, 
            I realized that this major doesn't really fit me, and I wasn't very happy with it. I feel like I can relate better 
            to the classes in my new major, especially since I started a **tutoring business**, which has been a great experience.
        </p>

        <p>
            With this class, I really just want to learn the basics, and I am happy with the results so far!
