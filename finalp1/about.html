        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I love gardening and animals in general. In my free time, I play golf, paint, hike, knit, bake, cook, and watch shows. I am a content creator on social media, and I have built a large community with over 1 million followers.</p>
        <p>I am currently in the process of switching my major from Software Development to Business. After two years of college, I realized that Software Development doesn’t really fit me, and I wasn’t very happy with it. I feel like I can relate better to the classes in Business, especially since I started a tutoring business that has been very successful.</p>
        <p>With this class, I really just want to learn the basics of web development, and so far, I am happy with the results.</p>
